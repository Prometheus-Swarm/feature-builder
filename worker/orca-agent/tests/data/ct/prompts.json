    "prompt": "Feature Overview:\nImplement a comprehensive dark mode feature for the web application that provides users with a seamless, accessible, and visually consistent alternative color scheme. The feature will include a user-controlled theme toggle, persistent preference storage, and a carefully designed color palette that ensures readability and visual comfort across all application components.\n\nAI Role and Expertise:\nYou are a senior full-stack web developer specializing in modern web application design, with expertise in:\n- Tailwind CSS configuration and theming\n- Responsive design and accessibility\n- JavaScript theme management\n- Web performance optimization\n- Cross-browser compatibility\n- User experience (UX) design principles\n\nImplementation Context:\nThe dark mode feature involves four primary implementation areas:\n1. Color Palette Design: Create a professional, accessible dark mode color scheme\n2. UI Toggle Mechanism: Develop a user-friendly theme switching interface\n3. Styling Implementation: Apply dark mode styles across all application components\n4. Preference Persistence: Store and recall user's theme preference\n\nTechnical Guidelines:\n- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and theme configuration\n- Implement dark mode using Tailwind's native dark mode classes\n- Follow WCAG 2.1 Level AA contrast ratio requirements (minimum 4.5:1)\n- Ensure zero-flicker theme switching\n- Support system preference detection\n- Optimize performance for theme toggling\n- Use semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes\n- Implement progressive enhancement\n\nCoding Standards:\n- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code\n- Follow single responsibility principle\n- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) with TypeScript preferred\n- Minimize external dependencies\n- Ensure cross-browser compatibility\n- Write comprehensive unit and end-to-end tests\n- Use consistent naming conventions\n- Implement proper error handling\n\nTask Dependencies and Relationships:\n- Color palette definition must precede styling implementation\n- Theme toggle requires color palette and base CSS variables\n- Persistence mechanism depends on toggle implementation\n- Accessibility and contrast validation should occur throughout implementation\n\nQuality and Testing Requirements:\n- 100% test coverage for theme switching logic\n- Validate color contrast for all UI elements\n- Test across multiple browsers and devices\n- Perform accessibility testing\n- Ensure smooth transitions between light and dark modes\n- Verify local storage persistence mechanism\n- Create detailed documentation for design decisions and implementation\n\nConstraints and Considerations:\n- Minimize performance overhead of theme switching\n- Provide fallback for browsers without JavaScript\n- Ensure theme toggle is keyboard accessible\n- Design should be inclusive and considerate of user preferences\n- Prioritize user experience and visual consistency\n\nDeliverable Expectations:\n- Fully functional dark mode with user toggle\n- Persistent theme preference\n- Consistent styling across all application components\n- Accessible and performant implementation\n- Comprehensive documentation of design and implementation choices\n\nSuccess Criteria:\n- Users can easily switch between light and dark modes\n- Theme preference persists across sessions\n- All application components are readable in both modes\n- No significant performance degradation\n- Meets WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards\n- Provides a cohesive and professional user experience",
