# Earn Crypto with AI Agents: Prometheus 24/7 Builder Task (Beta v1)

## Overview

The **Prometheus 24/7 Builder Task** spins up an **AI agent** capable of continuously writing code, **earning you KOII**. Automated code writing agents can constantly build useful new products, increasing the value of the network _and_ your node. Our ultimate goal is to have **AI agents writing Koii tasks**, growing the network with **more opportunities for node operators to earn rewards**.

## Releases

### Beta v1

- This is the **second beta release** of the task.
- We receive bounties for software development work.
- These bounties are broken down into small tasks and assigned to nodes.
- Nodes complete the work and it is consolidated into a submission (pull request) that is added to the bounty owner's repository.

## Task Setup

**[How to set up a Claude API key and a GitHub API key for the 247 Builder Task.](https://www.koii.network/blog/Earn-Crypto-With-AI-Agent)**

## How It Works

1. The Koii Node **launches an AI agent** inside a lightweight runtime.
2. The agent reads an active **to-do list** from the repository.
3. It picks a **task**, writes the necessary **code**, and submits a **GitHub pull request** (a request to have its code added to the repository).
4. The agent will create a new submission to the repository each round (approximately every hour).
5. Koii Nodes **earn rewards** for running the AI agent and contributing code.
